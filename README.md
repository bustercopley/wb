# tree

This is the 'tree' project, a C++20 implementation of a weight-balanced
binary tree. It provides an ordered associative container representing
an arbitrary sequence of values and allowing binary search with arbitrary
comparators (the user must establish the precondition that the sequence
is ordered compatibly with the comparators before performing a binary
search). See the comments in the file 'include/tree.hpp' for details.
